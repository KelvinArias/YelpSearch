## 🚀 Prerequisites

To use the yelp API, you must have an API_KEY, which you can generate at: (https://www.yelp.com/developers/graphql/guides/intro).

## 🚀 Usage

<ul>
    <li>Create an .env file</li>
    <li>Create a variable with the name API_KEY</li>
    <li>Put your API_KEY in the variable</li>
</ul>

Just run the following command at the root of the project:

```sh
npm i
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

`Note:` If you do not have an api key you can use the test data that is in the reducer to see the appearance of the cards (the functions do not work using this method)
